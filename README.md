# BEM_VelocityBC_3D
Simulate stokes flow in 3D, using Boundary Element Method, with specified velocity boundary condition

To run the code, open all the files in matlab and run "Run_main"

To change input variables like number of discreatized points per boundary, or the boundary velocities, edit "Inputs_Grids.m" file

While Giving the boundary velocities, please ensure to maintain mass balance.
